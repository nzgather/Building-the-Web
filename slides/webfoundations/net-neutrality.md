## Net Neutrality

**The Open Web philosophy helps us to maintain Net Neutrality.**

Net Neutrality is the idea that Internet providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally.

There should be no discrimination based on the user, content, site, application, or anything at all.

Note:
The Open Web is a set of philosophies we adhere to, Net Neutrality is the (hopeful) outcome of that.

Unfortunately, there are political and financial gains which could be made by treating networks differently, so this is a huge concern.

Open Web: Ensure that anyone can publish, implement, access.

Net Neutrality: A state of the internet where there is no access discrimination.
