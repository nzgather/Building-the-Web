## Your corner of the web

By creating your own website, you are taking ownership of a small portion of the world wide web. 

**It's all yours.**

You can publish and share anything you like, go forth and create!

Note:
Making our own website lets us shape the internet and share information with anyone in the world.

What would you like to share? Have a think about it, because today you get to make a website about anything you like.

Cats? Rugby? Surfing? Unicorns? Movies? Yourself? Anything goes. Have a think.
