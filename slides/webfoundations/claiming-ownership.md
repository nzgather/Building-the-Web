#### **Who owns the Internet?**

- Nobody
- Lots of people

#### **Who owns the World Wide Web?**

- Content Creators
- You!

Note:
Nobody can claim ownership of the internet, but many people own parts of the system which make the Internet possible.

The web is a set of documents, so nobody can claim ownership of the web either.

You still own your own contribution though, right?
