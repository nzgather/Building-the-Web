### An ISP can charge extra to allow access
### to your favourite website

<br>

e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google

Note:
What if the government or Telecom decided you had to pay $10 for every YouTube video you watched?

What if you had to pay an extra $50 a month for access to Facebook?

Even though YouTube and Facebook themselves are free, it is possible for ISPs to know what data you are accessing from which websites, and charge you for that.
