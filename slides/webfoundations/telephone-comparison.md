## Kinda like telephones!

The Internet can be compared to the telephone system:

- Nobody owns the whole thing
- Companies do control individual parts
- Telephone numbers and IP addresses are unique
- There is no central control room

Note:
Telephone numbers, IP addresses and street addresses are all unique locations across the whole planet.
