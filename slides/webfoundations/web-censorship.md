### A government can censor access to information

e.g. North Korea and China

Note:
Internet access is illegal in North Korea. Only a very few government officials have access to the internet through a secret connection. The rest of the citizens only have access to the country's own intranet.

This way, the government can control everything their citizens read on the internet, and ensures that nothing is published which disagrees with the government.

China controls all search engines to ensure that the citizens can find only the information they allow them to find.
