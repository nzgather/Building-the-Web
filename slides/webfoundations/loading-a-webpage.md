## Loading a Webpage

![Diagram of how a web page is served](images/diagram_http.png)

Note:
Client is your computer. (PC, laptop, phone)

ISP handles your internet account. (Telecom, Orcon, Vodafone)

Server is where web page files are stored. (Warehouses full of computers)

DNS stores list of names matched to IP addresses. (Map of URLs against IP addresses)

All these separate parts are owned by separate people.
