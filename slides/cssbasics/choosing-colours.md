## Colours

**CSS has support for some 'word' colours:**

	black, white, red, green, blue, purple, orange, and more

**But mostly, web developers use 'hex colours':**

	#000000, #FFFFFF, #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF

Hex colours are numeric representations of colours, <br>
allowing us a huge colour range to work with.

Note:
CSS does support some colours by name, but hex colours offer us far more flexibility.

Hex colours support over 16 million unique colours. Only 140 names are supported.
