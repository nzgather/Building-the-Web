## CSS Syntax

	h1 {
		color: red;
	}

Note:
In HTML we were using angle brackets, in CSS we use curly brackets.

This is what a single CSS rule looks like. This one changes the colour of H1 tags to red.

A CSS rule consists of a selector, plus one or more properties.

For this rule, the selector is h1 and the property we are changing is the color.
