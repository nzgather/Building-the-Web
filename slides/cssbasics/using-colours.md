## Using Colours

**Try using some of these colour properties in your css:**

	h1 {
		color: red;
		background-color: black;
		border: 2px solid #00FF00;
	}

You can choose your own hex colours at http://colorpicker.com

Note:
When using hex colours, make sure you include the hash before the number.

Colour words need to be written without a hash.

Also take note that the spelling of "color" is the American spelling without a 'u'.
