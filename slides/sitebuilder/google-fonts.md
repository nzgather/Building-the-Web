## Google Fonts

For a simple logo design, we can start by choosing a nice font.

Choose a font from Google Fonts and use it here.

	h1 {
		font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
	}

To use a Google Font

- Find a font
- Click the "Quick Use" icon
- Copy the code from "Step 3" into your HTML head section
- Use the font family from "Step 4" in your CSS

Note:
Explain a bit about font families and fallback options.

Explain that the bit we add to the HTML goes and gets the font from Google every time someone loads the page.
