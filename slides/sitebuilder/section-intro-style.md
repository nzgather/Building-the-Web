##Intro Section Style

So our text is on the page but it's just floating.

Let's give the section some design, using its name:

	.introduction {
		background-color: #222222;
		padding: 30px;
		width: 700px;
		margin: 0 auto;
		margin-top: 30px;

		color: #FFFFFF;
		font-size: 14px;
		line-height: 130%;
	}

Note:
The blank line is just to split up the layout stuff from the text design stuff.
