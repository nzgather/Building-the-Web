## Introduction Section

Let's create a section to greet visitors.

The section will tell them a bit about the topic we've chosen:

	<section class="introduction">

		<h2>Greetings, rabbit fans</h2>

		<p>This is a site all about my favourite animal, the rabbit.</p>

		<p>You will find some really nice pictures of rabbits, and a few of my favourite videos too.</p>

	</section>

Note:
A section is just another layout rectangle, like header.

It has no design by itself, it's just an invisible box to hold content.

First we will put in some content, then we will design the section.

Notice that we have given this section a name, or "class".
