## Links

**The link tag is the letter "a"**

	<a>Click here!</a>


**But we also need to tell the link where to go**


	<a href="http://google.com">Click here!</a>

We add the web address using the `href` attribute. 

Attributes allow us to add extra "hidden" information to tags.


Note:
The tag "a" means "anchor" but you can think of it meaning "action".

The attribute "href" means "hyperlink reference".
