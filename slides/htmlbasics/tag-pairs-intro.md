## Tag Pairs

Every tag pair consists of an opening tag and a closing tag.

	<tag> </tag>

And the actual content to display goes between them:

	<h1> My Awesome Page </h1>


Note:
As you can see from the code we just wrote, each piece of content we put on the page is contained between an open and a closing tag, which describes the type of content.

Note that the tags match, except for the forward slash in the closing tag.
