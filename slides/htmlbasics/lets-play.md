## Let's Play

### Basic Text Formatting
	
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>

	<p>This is a paragraph of normal text</p>
	
	<p>This is another paragraph</p>

Try formatting some text in [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/gist/334a12b63194776e5242)<!-- .element: target="_blank" -->




Note:
Some really common html tags, heading and paragraph. Note matching open and closing.

Also note it says h1 not hl or hi.
