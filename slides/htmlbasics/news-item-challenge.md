## Challenge

**Design your own "Breaking News" item:**

- Go to nzherald.co.nz
- Right click on the main story heading and 'Inspect Element'
- Edit the headline to make your own news!

**Try these too:**

- Modify the paragraph text to match your headline
- Change the image source to link to a different image
- Take a screenshot!

Note:
Now that you've learned a bit about how HTML is structured, let's try playing with some HTML on real websites.

Go to NZHerald, right click a heading, a paragraph, or an image and change the values to make some breaking news of your own.
